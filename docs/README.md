## Configuration

### App Settings
Edit `appsettings.json` to configure:

- Service settings

### Finding Your Plex Token
To get your Plex token for authentication:

1. **Open Plex Web App**: Go to your Plex server in a web browser
2. **Sign In**: Make sure you're signed in to your Plex account
3. **Get Token**: Visit this URL in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:32400/web/index.html#!/account
   ```
   (Replace `localhost:32400` with your Plex server address if different)

4. **Copy Token**: Look for "X-Plex-Token" in the URL or use browser developer tools:
   - Press `F12` to open developer tools
   - Go to the "Network" tab
   - Refresh the page
   - Look for any request and check the "X-Plex-Token" header

5. **Alternative Method**: Use Plex's token generator:
   - Visit: https://plex.tv/pms/resources.xml?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=YOUR_TOKEN
   - Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your actual token to verify it works

**Security Note**: Keep your Plex token secure and don't share it publicly.
